## Recompiling Builder.min.js and .css

When changes are made to js and css/less files you must recompile to see the changes.

To recompile you must have node.js installed.

In the main project directory run:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm install gulp -g`
3. `gulp`

From now on you only need to run the gulp command to recompile. The gulp compiler runs indefinitely until killed.

## Backend Updates

when new package appears in backend or database is changed:

* Make sure you have [downloaded and installed Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
* `cd backend`
* `composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist`
* `vendor/bin/phinx migrate`
     * You can configure `phinx.yml` for your own environment and run correspondingly `vendor/bin/phinx migrate -e local`
* If you are on Windows, you must use backslashes, i.e. `vendor\bin\phinx`

## Adding a new Component to architect

* Add your routes: `backend/builder/routes.php`
    * bind controller to container at the top of the document
    * lower down, put the routes
* Add your controller(s): `backend/builder/<Component>/<Component>Controller.php`
    * Because Sylex has different method of returning, you need to return `Response` objects, instead of the value you want
        * e.g. `return new Response($value, 200);`
        * e.g. `return new Response($err, 403);`
* Add views: `views/<component>`
* Modify angular stuff: `assets/js/builder/app.js`
